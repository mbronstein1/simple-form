# Simple Form

A simple form component built with vanilla JavaScript.

Includes conditional rendering, validation, and form submission feedback.

Manually manipulating attributes in the Developer Console like changing `email` input type to text or removing `required` fields will still cause the form to not submit if the necessary information is not present due to validation handled in the JavaScript, instead of just relying on the browser.
